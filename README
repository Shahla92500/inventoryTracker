A) How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this object-oriented program?
By checking the errors at compile time. 
By defining the classes we cannot assign a wrong type to a variable.
Methodes prevent the errors of wrong input/ouput types.
Interfaces defines the parameters and methodes that can be used.
Private & Protect , prevent any unauthorized access to properties or classes.

B) How did inheritance reduce code duplication for PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct?
we have already defiend the properties of SKU, Name and Price for product and it is not needed to redefine them.
Methods like displayDetails() and getPriceWithTax() were written once in Product and reused by both subclasses. 

C) What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private, protected) in this context? 
Encapsulation means hiding internal details of how a class works, exposing only what other code needs to use.
Preventing any unauthorized access which protects the data from being misused and also helps code mainance , also easier to add new features  


D) If you had to add a new type of product (e.g., a SubscriptionProduct), how would polymorphism make this extension straightforward?
in my opinion , now my code (eg: for (const product of products) => ...) works with any object that is a Product or its subclasses. 
if I add "SubscriptionProduct" (class SubscriptionProduct extends Product ....), I can ovveride displayDetail and getPriceWithTax so the main program does not change and the methodes like calculeTax() do not need to be changed and they continue to call existing methode
